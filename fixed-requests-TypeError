The issue is with python3-requests having a type error when using json=json in a class definition.

System Information:

# lsb_release -rd
Description:	Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
Release:	14.04

# apt-cache policy python3-requests
python3-requests:
  Installed: 2.2.1-1ubuntu0.2
  Candidate: 2.2.1-1ubuntu0.2
  Version table:

The class that is calling it has the following configuration:

def api_post(endpoint, headers=None, json=None, timeout=5):
    response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=json, timeout=5)
    if response.ok:
        return response
    else:
        error_handler(response)

The following error is reported when running my program:

  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/requests/api.py", line 44, in request
    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)
TypeError: request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'json'

This is resolved by removing the ubuntu package, and installing the python3-requests module from github. I believe that if the code is updated from github for the ubuntu package this could be resolved.
